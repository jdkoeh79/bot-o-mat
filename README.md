## Run Locally

The only requirement to run this locally is to have Node.js installed.  Works on version 12.12, not tested on earlier versions.

1. clone the repository
2. cd into the directory and run `npm install`
3. run `node index.js`

## Run in a Docker container

The only requirement for this is that you have the Docker desktop app installed and running.

1. clone the repository
2. cd into the directory and run `docker image build -t botomat .`
3. run `docker run -it botomat`

##### Enjoy!
